И наконец самое интересное письмо №4, в котором меня просят заплатить всего 820 долларов на &#8220;карманные расходы&#8221;

I received your email and I want to introduce myself to you that I am Barrister Peter Kanayo and I will like to inform you that I will be traveling to South Africa for a seminar next week so lets conclude this claim immediately so that I can travel.

I wish to enlighten you on the procedure involved in this transaction.

1. I have to go to the Federal High Court of Nigeria to swear and obtain an affidavit of claim which will empower me and make the bank to allow me to act/sign the final release order of your winning fund on your behalf in the UNION BANK OF Nigeria’s head Office.

2.When I finish swearing the affidavit from the High court then I have to proceed to the bank immediately to sign the final release order of your winning fund which will enable the bank to transfer your fund or to send your cheque to your address.If you want to hire me to represent you to sign this document then I will require you to send me the sum of $820 through Western Union Money Transfer to enable me receive  
it fast enough today so that I can get the job done. This is the breakdown of the $820 which I have ask you to send as stated below:

To obtain Affidavit of Claim from the High court: $420  
Miscellaneous: $100  
Service Charge: $300  
Total: $820

It is worthy to also let you know that the bank told me that your money has been deposited by cheque with your security file number and has been insured under bank insurance policy which means that nobody has any legal right to deduct money from your winning cheque or to rewrite the cheque after deducting money for expences from your  
winnings because the cheque has been sent from the Spanish Lottery to be paid to the real beneficiary of the award with that security number after the bank has gone through the person&#8217;s personal details and winning details and sign the final release order at the bank&#8217;s head office in Lagos Nigeria,and you know I need some money to be able to finalize your papers now.

If my conditions are okay by you, then reach me immediately so that I will give you the informations to send the money through western Union Money transfer so that I can get it fast enough to do your job, I need to hear from you ASAP to enable me conclude the transaction if possible monday morning so that the bank will make transfer of your winning fund the same day.

вот такие пироги, друзья мои.

вчера ко мне обратилась еще одна &#8220;девушка&#8221; из Либерии за помощью. На сей раз надо помочь вывезти из страны 6,5 миллионов долларов США.
