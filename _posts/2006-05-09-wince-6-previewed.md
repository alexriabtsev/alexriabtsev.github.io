Microsoft just dolled-up Windows CE in a new beta dress dubbed Windows CE 6 and turned her out at the Mobile and Embedded DevCon show in Vegas baby, Las Vegas. The new flavor of this embedded OS features a redesigned kernel with expanded capacity for up to 32k simultaneous processes while remaining true to the features and functionality of previous CE generations. So what the hell does that mean to you? Well, as the basis for [Windows Mobile](http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2006/04/28/crossbow-to-be-windows-mobile-6-0/) we should see new products based on both embedded CE (set-top boxes, industrial automation and medical devices) as well as sophisticated SmartPhones and PocketPCs coming sometime in 2007.
